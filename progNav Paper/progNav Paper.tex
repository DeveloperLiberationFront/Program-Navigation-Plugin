\begin{abstract}
Program navigation is a critical task for software developers. 
Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art tools do not adequately support developers in simultaneously navigating both control flow and data flow (i.e. program flow). 
To assist developers in effectively navigating program flow we designed and implemented a tool that leverages powerful program analysis techniques while maintaining low barriers to invocation.
Our tool enables developers to systematically navigate program flow upstream and downstream within the Eclipse IDE.
Based on a preliminary evaluation with 8 participants, our tool compares well to existing tools. 
%Something about tradeoffs.
%For simple sub-tasks tool was effective with very few interface elements.

\section{Introduction}
Modern software systems contain millions of lines of source code. 
As software grows in size and complexity, developers increasingly rely on tools to help them navigate the programs they create. 
Program navigation is a central task tied to many critical activities, including exploring new code bases, debugging, and assessing security vulnerabilities. 

While navigating programs, developers ask questions about control flow and data flow throughout the program~\cite{latoza2010hard, Smith2015}. We will refer to these two concepts together as \textit{program flow}. Developers are interested in navigating program flow to trace how data is modified across multiple method invocations.

Integrated development environments (IDEs) present code linearly in the order methods are defined. However, successful developers do not navigate source code linearly (line by line starting at the top of the file). Instead, they methodically navigate the code's hierarchical semantic structures~\cite{robillard2004investigate}. To resovle this conflict and realize their ideal navigation strategies, developers rely on program navigation tools. 

% Probably more to come in here? What are some current tools and why are they limited.
% Discuss program visualization tools vs navigation tools.

In this work we will design, implement, and evaluate a program navigation tool.
To address the limitations of existing program navigation tools, our tool will embody five key design principles (Section \ref{DesignPrinciples}). We will implement our tool as a plugin to the Eclipse IDE. 

This paper makes the following contributions:


\section{Background}
Summary of related work, including a table evaluating existing tools on various design principles.
Spoiler alert, none of the tools satisfy all of the principles.


\section{Design Principles and Implementation}
\label{DesignPrinciples}
In this section we describe the design principles that we used to shape \toolName. We derived these design principles by evaluating the limitations of existing program navigation tools.
 
\vspace{1em} 
\noindent\textbf{Powerful Program Analysis -}
By leveraging powerful program analysis techniques, navigation tools can provide more accurate information.
For example, by analyzing abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and call graphs, tools can make proper references to variables and methods. 
Simple textual analysis may lead to inaccurate results, especially when programs include inheritance and duplicate variable names.

\vspace{1em} 
\noindent\textbf{Low Barriers to Invocation -}
Barriers to invocation may inhibit adoption. 
As developers may wish to navigate multiple program paths concurrently, repetitively invoking the tool may be cumbersome, especially if barriers are high. 


\vspace{1em} 
\noindent\textbf{Full Program Navigation -}
Developers are not only interested in traversing programs' call graph, but also how data flows through the call graph.
To do so, developers must inspect the relationship between methods as well as the methods themselves.
Often the methods of interest span across multiple source files.
Furthermore, program navigation tools should support this traversal both upstream and downstream. 
That is, tools should highlight variable assignments and also subsequent variable uses. 

\vspace{1em} 
\noindent\textbf{In Situ Results -}
Switching between views in the IDE can cause disorientation~\cite{deAlwis2006disorient}. As developers navigate through code, navigation tools should present their results in that context. 
When navigation tools present results outside the code, developers are burdened with the cognitive load of translating those results back to the code.



\section{\toolName}
We implemented \toolName~as a plugin to the Eclipse IDE~\cite{Eclipse}. We chose Eclipse because of its popularity and extensibility. 
Eclipse is one of the most widely used open source IDEs for Java development and it provides many extension points for plugins.

\section{Preliminary Evaluation}

\subsection{Tasks}
We will ask developers to perform two tasks that involve program flow navigation (Task 1 and Task 3 from \cite{Smith2015}).

\subsection{Participants}
We plan to perform a preliminary evaluation of \toolName with eight developers.
Our goals are to get some initial feedback on the usability of our tool and evaluate whether our approach shows promise in enabling developers to efficiently navigate program flow. 

\subsection{Usability Evaluation}
To evaluate the usability of \toolName, we administered an adapted version of the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ)~\cite{Lewis95ibmcomputer}. We modified the questionnaire by replacing ``this system'' with ``this tool'' and asked questions from the System Quality and Interface Quality categories. We asked 10 questions; participants responded on a 7-point Likert scale from ``Strongly Disagree'' to ``Strongly Agree.'' 	
We also asked participants open-ended questions based on applicable categories from Nielsen's usability heuristics~\cite{Nielsen1992}

To capture participant's experiences that these two approaches overlooked, two of the authors independently examined each audio/video recording 

\section{Results}
Hopefully, participants are faster/more accurate with the tool. Rate positive experience on the questionnaire.

\section{Discussion}


\subsection{Systematic Evaluation}
Program navigation tools should help developers keep track of where they have been and where they are going. Especially while attempting to resolve complex defects, developers may want to thoroughly explore all program paths. Their navigation tools should help them keep track of their progress.
